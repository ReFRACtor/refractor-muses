# Step 2: Pair
# Read OMI and AIRS data.  Find best and closest matches
# for each dataset; each satellite observation is used at most
# one time.  The maximum allowed are 1 degree longitude, 1/2
# degree latitude, 50 km, and delta_min minutes.  It writes all
# pairs out into the output directory as a savefile
#
# IDL program usage: observation_pairing -args
#  AIRS Geolocation File Directory : AIRS geolocation .sav file location
#  OMI Geolocation File Directory  : OMI geolocation .sav file location
#  Output Path                     : outputs a single .sav file of combined airs and omi
#  Year                            : year to be processed
#  Month                           : month to be processed
#  Day                             : day to be processed
