    Note that there a refractor.framework class StrategyExecutor. This class has a
    similar intention as that older StrategyExecutor class, however this really
    is a complete rewrite of this for the way py-retrieve does this. It is possible
    that these classes might get merged at some point, but for now it is better
    to think of these as completely separate classes that just happen to have similar
    names.

    The canonical way of determining the strategy is to read the old strategy table
    ("Table.asc") that amuse-me populates.

    This base class provides an abstract interface so we can have different implementations
    of executing a strategy.
