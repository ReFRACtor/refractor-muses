This is the extracted routines from Frank Werner's Zendo record
(https://zenodo.org/records/16968703). This is extracted pieces from
the troppy and eclair packages, although there seems to be some changes
here.

Not really clear if this belongs here in refractor, but we don't have an
obvious other place to put this. For now, we will have this here although
it may move. It isn't clear what the OSR acroynm is, but that is what this
is called in the Zendo record.
