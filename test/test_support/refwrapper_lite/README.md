# refwrapper_lite

This is a stripped down version of some code I wrote to wrap ReFRACtor for offline
use to generate SWIR spectra (https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/laughner/tropess-swir-dev/tree/master/src/refwrapper).
Tests that use this and fail may not necessarily indicate a problem with ReFRACtor,
just a change that required an update in how I interact with it.
